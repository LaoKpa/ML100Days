    "    A one-dimensional CNN is a CNN model that has a convolutional hidden layer that operates over a 1D sequence. This is followed by perhaps a second convolutional layer in some cases, such as very long input sequences, and then a pooling layer whose job it is to distill the output of the convolutional layer to the most salient elements.\n",

    "    Alex Graves have combined multidimensional LSTM with connectionist temporal classification and a hierarchical layer structure to create a powerful offline handwriting recogniser. The system is very general, and has been successfully applied to English as well as Arabic. Indeed, since the dimensionality of the networks can be changed to match that of the data, it could in principle be used for almost any supervised sequence labelling task.\n",
